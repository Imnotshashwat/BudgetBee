# Expense Tracker

This project is a simple web app for tracking your daily expenses and managing your monthly budget. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers and mobile devices.

## Features

- Choose between light and dark mode (toggle in the top-right)
- Add, view, and delete your expenses (each expense includes a description, amount, category, and date)
- Set your personal monthly budget at the top and see how much you have left in real time
- Live warning if you go over budget or get close to your monthly limit
- See a colorful doughnut chart showing your spending by category (thanks, Chart.js!)
- Your data stays private—everything is stored in your browser, so nobody else sees it

## How to Use

1. **Set your budget:** Enter your monthly budget and click "Save Budget."
2. **Add expenses:** Fill in the description, amount, and category, then click "Add."
3. **Monitor:** The chart and the totals update instantly every time you add or delete an expense.
4. **Change styles:** Click the moon/sun button for dark or light mode.
5. **Delete:** Use the "X" button to remove an item from your expense history.

## Getting Started

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. No installation or signup needed!

If you want to share this with others, you can host it using GitHub Pages, Replit, or any basic web server. *(If you're using GitHub Pages, your live URL could look like this: `https://yourusername.github.io/bca-first-year-projects/expense_tracker/`—update as needed.)*

## Technology

- HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Chart.js for drawing the category chart

## Why I Made This

I wanted a hassle-free way to manage my spending that worked well on my phone and stored everything locally. This project also helped me practice JavaScript and data visualization.
